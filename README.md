We understand that for newcomers, the world of open source can appear daunting, with its multitude of files and issues. Even when a promising "good first issue" is found, it can be challenging to determine where to begin. That's why at Intellectia, we are committed to simplifying the path for new contributors to make a meaningful impact.

Our approach is to provide well-documented issues that serve as a clear roadmap to the problem area. We don't provide solutions; instead, we guide you on where to look for bugs or opportunities for improvement. Our primary goal is to create a welcoming and developer-friendly environment, particularly for students and open-source newcomers.

If you find our repository helpful, we kindly ask you to share this resource with your college community. Our aim is to facilitate real-world experience in large-scale project development. Please note that during the review process, we maintain transparency and offer constructive feedback. If you're open to learning and growing through constructive criticism, we invite you to contribute to our project. If not, we encourage you to explore other repositories for your contributions.

## Do we use AI?
Yes, we do utilize AI technology within our platform. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable our users to engage in conversations with `Intellectia` and seek answers to their questions. It's important to note that our AI system retrieves responses solely from our carefully curated database and knowledge base. These resources are comprised of trusted articles written by human experts and reviewed by human editors. We have a strict policy in place to exclude any content generated by AI algorithms.

The rationale behind this policy is to address concerns related to potential misinformation or inaccuracies that can arise from AI-generated content. LLMs, including those from OpenAI, have been known to generate persuasive yet factually incorrect information, which can lead to misunderstandings or inaccuracies. By relying exclusively on human-reviewed and curated content, we aim to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability in the information provided to our users.

Think of "Intellectia" as a vast library of knowledge that users can engage with through conversational interactions. We achieve this through the use of LLM technology, although it's important to clarify that we don't utilize OpenAI models specifically. Instead, we are considering the adoption of the "https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/" technology, which appears to be a promising choice for our platform. This decision aligns with our commitment to delivering accurate and trustworthy information to our users while leveraging advanced AI tools to enhance their experience.

## Intellectia's Content Verification Process: Keeping It Reliable
To maintain accuracy in the articles you find on Intellectia, we take a special approach. See, it's really tough for computers to spot if a piece of writing was done by a smart AI like chatGPT or a human 🤖🧑. So, we rely on real people to check.

Here's how it works: When someone wants to share an article on Intellectia, we don't just post it right away. Instead, we send it to a group of reviewers 👩‍⚖️👨‍⚖️. These are users who are pretty smart in certain topics 🧠. They pick at least three areas they're good at and review articles related to those topics. For an article to go live, it needs the thumbs-up from at least half of these reviewers 👍👍.

But here's the cool part: These reviewers are chosen carefully 🕵️‍♀️🕵️. We look at their past work and what they know to make sure they're the right folks for the job 🔍. So, anyone on Intellectia can be both a reviewer and a writer 📝👩‍⚖️, making our community strong and dependable. 💪

## Why Become a Reviewer? 🧐'
Ever wondered why someone would want to become a reviewer on Intellectia? 🤔

Well, here's the deal: Once a user becomes a reviewer for articles in a specific topic, Intellectia acknowledges their expertise. We do this by giving their profile a distinct appearance and a special, exclusive badge 🏅, signaling to the community that this person is an expert in the field they review articles in. Reviewers stand out among regular users on our platform, making them easily recognizable.

But that's not all! We keep track of every interaction with the articles, including the ones reviewed by our esteemed reviewers. This means that all the articles reviewed by a reviewer are proudly displayed on their profile, showcasing their contributions.

In addition to this, we go the extra mile by featuring our reviewers across various topics in the GitHub readme section. This exposure not only boosts their reputation but also opens up opportunities for high-paying jobs.

Becoming a reviewer on Intellectia is not just about contributing; it's about standing out, showcasing your expertise, and accessing exciting opportunities! 🚀

## Setup

***We are using `pnpm` as package manager for this project. Please make sure you [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed in your device***

**Project Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:prasenjeet-symon/intellectia.git
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**:

      ***Method 1 (Local Setup)***
      
      - Ensure you have XAMPP installed and running.

      - Create a MySQL database named "intellectia" for your project in XAMPP. Note down the database name, username, and password.

      - Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the `packages/server` directory.

      - Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your MySQL database connection details
    
    ***Method 2 (Using Docker)***

      - Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and [Docker Desktop setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed
        
      - Create `.env` file in the `./packages/server` directory using the template from `.env.example` file present there
        
      - Start docker deamon using the below mentioned command. This command will steup `mysql` at port 3307 and a basic admin gui at `localhost:8080`
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d
      ```
            
      - (Optional) For spinning only `mysql` server run 
      ```bash
      docker-compose up -d  db
      ```
3. **Server Setup**

   - Navigate to  `server` folder
      ```bash
      cd packages/server
      ```
   
   - Install packages
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

   - Run prisma migrate
      ```bash
      npx prisma migrate dev
      ```
   
   - Start the server
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

4. **Client Setup**

   - Navigate to  `client` folder
      ```bash
      cd packages/client
      ```
   
   - Install packages
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
   
   - Start the server
      ```bash
      npm dev
      ```
By following these setup instructions, you'll have your Express project located at 'packages/server' connected to a MySQL database using XAMPP, with database migration capabilities using Prisma, and environment variables properly configured. Make sure to adapt the configuration and environment variables to your specific project requirements.
